2. [ ] Verify page loads automatically (OnInit)
3. [ ] Verify multiple buildings are displayed
4. [ ] Verify building names, status, and tenant info shown
5. [ ] Click on a building
6. [ ] Verify navigation works

**Expected Result:** List loads automatically from MockRentalDatabaseService on page load

### Test 4: School Map Inquiry
1. [ ] Navigate to School Map Inquiry page
2. [ ] Fill in search criteria (governorate, stage, etc.)
3. [ ] Click Search
4. [ ] Verify loading indicator
5. [ ] Verify search results modal appears
6. [ ] Verify multiple buildings are displayed
7. [ ] Verify building data includes all fields

**Expected Result:** Search results load from MockBuildingDatabaseService

### Test 5: Study Period
1. [ ] Navigate to School Map Study Period page
2. [ ] Enter building code, center code, and branch code
3. [ ] Click Search
4. [ ] Verify modal appears with study period data
5. [ ] Verify two periods are shown (morning/evening)
6. [ ] Verify student counts display

**Expected Result:** Study periods load from MockSchoolMapDatabaseService

### Test 6: Building Displacement
1. [ ] Navigate to Building Displacement Post page
2. [ ] Verify school number and name load automatically
3. [ ] Verify form is populated with school data
4. [ ] Check that school name is dynamic (not hardcoded)

**Expected Result:** School data loads from MockDisplacementDatabaseService on page init

## 🔍 Code Verification

### Verify Imports
Check that updated components import from the correct locations:

```typescript
// Should import from models
import { XxxData } from '../../models/xxx.model';

// Should import mock services
import { MockXxxDatabaseService } from '../../services/mock-xxx-database.service';
```

### Verify Service Injection
Check that services are injected correctly:

```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  private xxxService = inject(MockXxxDatabaseService);
}
```

### Verify Service Calls
Check that methods are called with proper error handling:

```typescript
this.xxxService.getData().subscribe({
  next: (data) => {
    // Handle success
  },
  error: (error) => {
    // Handle error
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
});
```

## 📊 Console Verification

### Check for Errors
1. [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. [ ] Navigate to Console tab
3. [ ] Navigate through the application
4. [ ] Verify NO errors appear in console
5. [ ] Verify service calls are logged (if debug enabled)

### Check Network Activity (Mock Services)
Since these are mock services, there should be:
- [ ] NO actual HTTP requests to external APIs
- [ ] Data appears after simulated delay
- [ ] All data operations happen in-memory

## 🎨 Visual Verification

### Loading States
- [ ] Loading indicators appear during data fetching
- [ ] Loading indicators disappear after data loads
- [ ] UI doesn't freeze during data loading

### Data Display
- [ ] Arabic text displays correctly (RTL)
- [ ] All data fields are populated
- [ ] No "undefined" or "null" shown in UI
- [ ] Data appears realistic and varied

### Error Handling
- [ ] Error messages display in Arabic
- [ ] Application doesn't crash on errors
- [ ] User-friendly error messages appear

## 📱 Functional Tests

### Search Functionality
- [ ] Search with valid data returns results
- [ ] Search with different criteria returns different results
- [ ] Form validation works before search
- [ ] Required fields are enforced

### Data Persistence (Session)
- [ ] Navigate to a page and load data
- [ ] Navigate away and return
- [ ] Verify data loads again (not persisted between navigation)
- [ ] Refresh page - data resets (this is expected for mock services)

### Modal/Popup Functionality
- [ ] Popups open correctly
- [ ] Data displays in popups
- [ ] Popups close correctly
- [ ] No data corruption between popup opens

## 🔧 Development Tools Verification

### TypeScript Compilation
Run in terminal:
```bash
# This should complete without errors
ng build --configuration development
```
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting warnings for updated files

### Type Checking
In your IDE:
- [ ] No red squiggly lines in updated components
- [ ] Autocomplete works for service methods
- [ ] Autocomplete works for model properties
- [ ] Type hints appear correctly

## 📚 Documentation Verification

### Read Documentation
- [ ] `DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md` opens correctly
- [ ] `MOCK_SERVICES_GUIDE.md` opens correctly
- [ ] `COMPONENT_SERVICE_MAPPING.md` opens correctly
- [ ] `DYNAMIC_DATA_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` opens correctly

### Documentation Content
- [ ] Code examples are formatted correctly
- [ ] Links to files are accurate
- [ ] Information is clear and understandable
- [ ] Migration steps are detailed

## ✨ Edge Cases

### Empty Results
- [ ] Search with criteria that returns no results
- [ ] Verify empty state is handled gracefully
- [ ] Verify no errors occur

### Invalid Input
- [ ] Submit form with invalid data
- [ ] Verify validation errors appear
- [ ] Verify no API calls made with invalid data

### Rapid Clicks
- [ ] Click search button multiple times rapidly
- [ ] Verify loading state prevents multiple calls
- [ ] Verify no race conditions occur

## 🎯 Performance Check

### Load Times
- [ ] Initial page load is fast (<2 seconds)
- [ ] Data loads in 300-800ms (simulated delay)
- [ ] No noticeable lag in UI
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions

### Memory
- [ ] Open DevTools Performance tab
- [ ] Navigate through pages
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks
- [ ] Verify reasonable memory usage

## 🔄 Integration Readiness

### For Future Backend Integration
- [ ] All service methods have clear signatures
- [ ] Return types match expected API responses
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Loading states are implemented

### Migration Path
- [ ] `DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md` provides clear steps
- [ ] Backend API requirements are documented
- [ ] Example code for real API services is provided
- [ ] Rollback plan is documented
